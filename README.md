# Raytracing in Rust

This is my implementation of the great book:

[Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

in Rust instead of C++

## Features
- PPM Image format to display images
- Anti-Aliasing
- Parallelism with Rayon
- Customizable scene layout and camera position


I might do the rest of the [3-Part series on raytracing](https://raytracing.github.io) later, but until then, here's the code!
